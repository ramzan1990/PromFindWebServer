    <h4>PromID</h4>
     <p class="pct" >
       PromID is a sequence-based human TSS predictor built using deep learning. Taking advantage of big promoter collection
with experimentally validated TSSs generated by modern
high-throughput techniques, PromID builds a deep learning model using sequence data as its input.
To avoid bias based on prior knowledge about promoter
loci e.g, sequences with known core promoter elements
and high density of CpG dinucleotides; PromID does not
use predefined features but rather it attempts to discover
sequence features and learn salient patterns of the human
promoter solely from the training set. This is important
especially in the prediction of human promoters since the
structural features of many promoters are still unknown.
We previously developed a similar convolutional
neural network-based algorithm for the prediction of core
promoter locations in several model organisms. While
this method was able to outperform previously developed
state-of-the-art promoter prediction methods, its false
positive rate was not adequate enough to ensure the accurate
detection of promoters on long genomic sequences. PromID
was developed to chiefly alleviate this limitation and to
focus more on the promoter prediction on longer sequences.
Specifically, to reduce the false positive rate, we designed
PromID to adaptively train the predictor by changing the
distribution of samples in the training set based on falsepositive
errors it made in the previous iteration. By increasing
the weight of difficult non-promoter sequences in the training
set, we can encourage the predictor to learn patterns to rule
out such sequences
